# First_Android_App_with_Java
This is an app I created using a preset from Android Studio and converted it into an app with a User interface and buttons which do things when clicked. Each button has it own function.

"Toast" button: shows "Hello Toast!" when clicked
"count" button: everytime it clicks it adds 1 to the number being displayed on your device. 
"random" button: naviagtes to a second User interface page where it tells you a random number and it tells you the interval in which it chose the number from.
